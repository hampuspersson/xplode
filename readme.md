## XPLODE
Xplode is a new way to manage, report and give feedback on your athletes work in the gym. Create drills, sets, programs and tests and have your athletes log their workouts in the system. Once that is done it's a breeze to track results, give feedback and modify to suit the indivuals within your group.

Xplode is built on Laravel and Angular.js. It's fully responsive and runs on every device that has a web browser. If you would like to contribute to this project please drop me a note at hampus@hampuspersson.se
